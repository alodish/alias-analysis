# Alias Analysis

Examined GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) vectors in an attempt to find nicknames for proper names

In collaboration with [Doug Horner](https://github.com/horner)

### Notes

Check out the [notebook](https://github.com/alodish/alias-analysis/blob/main/alias-analysis.ipynb) file in this directory to see results

I had hoped to share all of my .pkl files, but they are far too large. The text files are available [here](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe)

After downloading the text file(s) of your chosing, feel free to use the pickle-dicts.py file to convert them all to Pickle files

Thank you to Stanford's NLP GloVe group for the countless hours they put into this project!
